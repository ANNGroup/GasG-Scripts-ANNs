# GasG-Scripts-ANNs
Six codes or scripts written in Matlab for the training of several artificial neural networks and to be able to estimate the bottom hole temperature of geothermal systems using the chemical composition of the gas-phase of geothermal fluids.

Release Notes:

To start training artificial neural network with our codes or scripts, open Matlab and any code. Then run "main window" of editor in Matlab.

The training of de neuronal network will finish when all iterations are done. A report in txt file is generated with the best architectures as a result of the training.
